# UI Redesign Phase 2 — execution record

Direction is fixed: C Data-forward Health Intelligence, restrained Warm Personal Wellness, iOS-first private Personal Health OS. Do not rebuild the app, add business modules, change providers/algorithms, or push/merge without approval.

The user requires sequential page gates: analyze → whole test suite → real Flutter screenshot review → independent critique → commit, then the next page. Native device limitations stay explicit.

| Stage | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Global Navigation | Complete: analyze clean, 69 whole-suite tests pass, seven actual captures manually reviewed; A/B finish confirmation; original priorities closed |
| Home | Source/baseline pre-review; not implemented |
| Nutrition + Draft Review | Not started |
| Training | Not started |
| AI Coach | Not started |
| Profile / Settings | Not started |
| Shared States | Incremental extraction with first consumers, final audit later |
| Dark / Accessibility / Polish | Per-page checks plus final consolidated gate |

## Navigation review

Method: independent A `ui_review_a` / B `ui_review_b`, read-only; implementation is main-agent-only. A's unanchored baseline score is 27/32 (heuristics 9 and 10 not applicable to the tab bar alone). Low cognitive load: five explicit destinations are appropriate native top-level sections, not a reason to reduce the app to four.

P1: the Flutter SDK internally clamps BottomNavigationBar label text scaling. Fixed by scaling the typography role before passing it to both label size and styles. P2: selection relied mainly on color. Fixed with selected label weight 600, same positions and icon family. No capsules, altered destinations, replacement navigation model or gesture interception.

B actually attempted the bundled Dart detector; stdout `[]`, exit 0, native Dart unsupported. This is not a clean-native finding. No browser overlay/server was started for native review.

Six tests cover widths 320 / 393 / 430, light and dark, 200% text: actual text growth, all labels hit-testable, selected/tap semantics, and iOSTapTargetGuideline. The original 47 business/widget tests remain untouched. Seven explicit existing goldens were captured for navigation changes and manually viewed by the main agent; they were not blanket-accepted from a failed suite.

> Codex native hook approval entry unavailable in current environment.

No hook trust bypass/disable. Current evidence is Windows Flutter test-engine/source, not actual VoiceOver, iPhone gestures, haptics or physical performance. The owner needs no local Mac to continue this rollout.
